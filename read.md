I have a project in my directory that I want you to analyze. Please scan all the files in my project and help me debug the following error I’m getting on my GitHub Pages deployment:

admin.html?email=cot…m&password=qwerty:1 
Uncaught TypeError: Failed to resolve module specifier "@supabase/supabase-js". 
Relative references must start with either "/", "./", or "../".


Please:

Identify the exact cause of the error.

Suggest the correct way to import and use @supabase/supabase-js in a browser environment (since GitHub Pages doesn’t support Node-style imports).

Recommend changes to my project files to fix the issue and get Supabase working correctly.


Point out any other related issues in my code that might break on GitHub Pages.
